- Interface is used to achieve full abstraction.
- The [[Abstract classes and methods]] are used for abstraction but they are not completely abstract, as the methods can be defined in the abstract classes.
- In Interface the methods cannot be defined, they must be implemented in the class which are deriving from the interface.
- Interface cannot be instantiated.
- Interfaces allow for multiple inheritance.
- In interface all properties are public and need to be implemented in the derived class.
