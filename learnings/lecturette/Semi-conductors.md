- Introduction - 
	- Semiconductors are elements that posses certain physical properties. Conductors are elements that conduct heat and electricity. Insulators do not conduct heat and electricity. Semiconductors posses both, properties which make them useful for conduction and insulation of electricity.
	- Semiconductors are made mostly of silicon and germanium. Semiconductors display large number of useful properties that make them suitable for using in electronics, one most important property is the ability that semiconductor has to change its conductivity. 
		- To change the conductivity, a impurity can be added to the element to alter the conductivity of semi-conductors crystal structure. 
		- When two regions with different impurities are found in one crystal, they form semiconductor junction.
		- The process of adding impurity to alter conductivity of a semiconductor is called "doping".
		- The doped semi-conductors are called extrinsic semiconductors.
		- There are two types of doping, the categorization is based on the Group that the impurity element belongs to - 
			- n-type doping - adding Group 5 - makes donor
			- p-type doping - adding Group 3 - makes acceptor.
		- Semi-conductors can have many n type and p type areas, they can have n-p junctions(Homo junctions). They can be mixed to create a unique combination of doping that satisfies the use case.
	- Usage of Semi-conductors in everyday life - 
		- CPU, ACs, Microwave, LEDs, ATMs, Phone, TVs, Radios, Chargers, Remote controllers.
		- Semi-conductors are used in electronics for they allow the ability to control the flow of current and heat receptivity.
		- Computer systems have semi-conductors in large numbers, as the parts of a computer system are created using semi-conductors.
