1. What are Nuclear weapons?
	 - Nuclear weapons are made by chemical reaction of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. Basically splitting a electron in two causes large amounts of energy to be dispersed.
	 - Nuclear weapons are capable of destroying a large amount of landmass and leaves the blast area with nuclear contamination leaving it unhabitable for any living beings.

2. What is the current scenario?
	- Some countries have declared their nuclear arsenal, the countries are India, Pakistan, USA, Russia, Germany and many more.
	- After the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, the UN has made a treaty for Nuclear weapons.
	- The Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), came into effect in 2021. The treaty make prohibits the development, testing, stockpiling and use of Nuclear weapons. And also prohibits the support for any nuclear related activities.
	- India has not agreed with TPNW as for our neighbors activities on nuclear weapons. Instead India believes in Nuclear disarmament through step by step process.
	- For the largest amount of nuclear weapons, Russia has a massive arsenal of 5500 warheads. The USA is next with 5200 warheads.

3. What does the future hold for nuclear weapons?
	- The USA government still is taking care of people from Bikini Atoll, a island from the Marshal Island group, as it performend the largest explosion test for a nuclear warhead, leaving the island unhabitable and full of nuclear radiation.
	- The people of that island are unable to come back to the island since 1946.
	- That clearly states that Nuclear weapons are harmful for living beings, but remain a necessity for political and military security.
	- India's stance of nuclear disarmament could be the stance that each other nation must take and dispose all the nuclear weapons to ensure that no situation like Hiroshima and Nagasaki re occures.
