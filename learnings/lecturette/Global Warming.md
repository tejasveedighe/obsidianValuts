1. What is global warming?
	- Global warming is the phenomenon of increasing temperature of the atmosphere, due to trapping of heat by green house gases.
	- The main green house gas is carbon dioxide, and methane.
	- The rising of temperature of atmosphere alters the climate causing changes in crop cycles, and melting of polar ice in arctic.
	- Global warming is due to large emission of green house gases in the atmosphere due to burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and other activities.
	- The melting of polar ice and increase in temperature will cause the level of ocean to increase, make certain areas too hot, and  also cause the submersion of land underwater, that will cause large population to migrate, causing a refugee problem.

2. How to fix global warming?
	- Avoiding deforestation and doing afforestation
		- The CO2 will be absorbed by the trees.
		- Trees and plants help in maintaining the climate cycle.
	- Replacing fossil fuels
		- Replacing the source of energy from fossil fuels will make drastic changes as fuel is the lead cause of CO2 emission.
		- Electric vehicles are the future for a emission free energy.

3. Conclusion 
	- Global warming is not a nation based problem it is a problem for each human and other living being on the earth. 
	- All the people must come together to fight this problem.
	- Small changes that an individual could make will compound to huge environmental savings.
	- Suppose each person could reduce the CO2 footprint by taking one day using public transport or any mode of transport that has less emission, will lead to the world having a least emission day when looking at global scale.
	- Plantation is the best option to avoid global warming.
