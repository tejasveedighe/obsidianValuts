### Kitty
- We are using kitty as it was pre-installed with [[Hyprland]].
- The current config of kitty does the following - 
  1. set the default shell to [[Fish shell|fish]]
  2. set background opacity for transparent features.
  3. set the font for terminal to `Dark Mono`, and font size.
  4. start `uwsm`.
