- Synchronous = 
	- Running at the same time or rate as something else.
	- Running one after another, 
	- Running process that blocks the thread until the operation is complete. Nothing else can be done without one over.
- Asynchronous = 
	- Running not concurrent in time, happening at different rates and times.
	- Running simultaneously without influence of the other.
	- The thread is not blocked and the next operation can be run without completion of one.
	- Async methods **do not require multi-threading**, they do not run on a new thread but are run on [[Synchronization Context]].
