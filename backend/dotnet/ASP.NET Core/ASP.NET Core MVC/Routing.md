- Routing is the process of matching the pattern of URL to a specific controller and its action.
- Routing = URL + HTTP Request
- Types of Routing - 
	- Convention-based routing
		- The routing is done on the basis of configuration done in routing middleware.
		- Predefined URL patterns are used to determine the controller and action method to execute.
		- `app.UseRouting();` to enable routing in app
		- `app.MapControllerRoute(...config);
		- `app.MapGet("/", action);` for GET request on that route.
		- `app.Map("/", action);` for all HTTP request on that route.
		- `app.UseEndpoints(endpoint => (endpoint) => {});` for making new
	- Attribute-based routing
		- Routes are defined using attributes on Controllers and action methods.
		- `[Route("products/details/{id}")]` on a action method will map this URL to that method.
		- `[Route("[controller]")]` will use the name of controller or action for that route
		- `[Route("~/")]` for all the routes from domain
- Combination of conventional and attributes based routing is possible in an asp.net app.
