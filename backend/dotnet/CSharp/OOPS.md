- The key concepts of OOPs are
	- [[Classes and Objects]] 
		- The class is used to create a representation/blueprint of an entity, it contains all the properties and information of its behavior.
		- Objects are used to make classes alive, objects are instances of classes, and they are the ones who have the behavior.
	- [[Abstraction]]
		- Hiding the background details and representing the essential feature.
		- Abstraction is done using abstract classes.
	- [[Encapsulation]]
		- It is the process of containing all the similar data member into one unit.
		- It is to hide the data members from other objects, using keywords.
		- Private, public, protected, internal, protected internal are the keywords are used to change the accessibility to a data member.
	- [[Inheritance]]
		- Inheritance is the process of getting the properties of another class.
	- [[Polymorphism]]
		- Means that a thing can have multiple forms.
		- One function with the same name can have different implementations and different outputs.
		- This is done by altering the declaration method of a function, changing the parameters
