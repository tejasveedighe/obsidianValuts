- Abstract methods are the methods that are declared using the abstract keyword.
- Abstract classes or interface are the classes that do not have a implementation or body.
- Abstract classes are the opposite of concrete classes.
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, they need to be derived first and them implemented in child classes.
- The abstract class must be implemented completely or will get compile time error.
- The abstract methods must be implemented in the derived class using the override keyword.
