- Classes are of the following types - 
	- Abstract Class
	- Concrete Class
	- [[Sealed Class]]
	- [[Partial Class]]
	- [[Static Class]]
- Classes contain constructors which are used to initialize the properties of the class.
	- Constructors are defined in the following 3 ways -
		1. Implicitly Defined - Also called the default constructors, and are defined without any parameters. They initialize the properties with default values.
		2. Implicitly Defined Public constructor
		3. Explicitly Defined Constructor - These are user defined constructors which are used to execute a certain behavior when an object is initialized for the class.
		```
		[<modifiers>] <class name> ([paramter list]) 
		{
			// statements
		}
		```
	- Constructors are of the following types - 
		1. Default or parameter less constructors
		2. Parameterized constructors
		3. Copy constructors
