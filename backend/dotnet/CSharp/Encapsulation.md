- In Encapsulation we hide the internal functionality of an object and only allow access through set of public methods.
- The binding of state, and behavior into one unit is called Encapsulation.
- Data Hiding in Encapsulation is done by using Access Specifiers:
	1. public
	2. private
	3. protected
	4. internal
	5. protected internal
