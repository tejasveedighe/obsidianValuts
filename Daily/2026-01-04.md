- Chess Project learning - 
	- When the pawn piece was killing the black one, the black piece was not getting updated to the piece that killed it.
		- Reason - 
			- The Board component passes the piece data to ChessPiece Component via props.
			- The props did change in the parent component but the change were not recognized for the child component.
			- Since the loop in BoardComponent did not have a key passed to the child component, the re-render for that piece was not recognized.
		- Fix -
			- Key attribute to wrap the component call in BoardComponent.
```c#
			@for(int i ...)
			{
				@for(int j ...)
				{
					Piece piece = _board[i, j];
					<ChessPiece @key=piece.ToString()" piece="_board[i, j]" />
				}
			}
```
