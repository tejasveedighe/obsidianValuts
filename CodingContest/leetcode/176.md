#### Count of contest this year - 2

- Was able to solve 3 questions with 2 accepted.
- The third problem was a dp or greedy based problem and was not able to create a time efficient solution.
- Need to learn about greedy and dp patterns.
- The first two questions were actually very simple but still it took me about 35-40 minutes to complete them.
- Top contestant solve the questions within 2 minutes. They directly wrote the most efficient code for all problems. 
- I have not yet seem the solution for 3rd and 4th question solutions. That will be the learning ones and will have to incorporate the methods that i learnt from them to other contests.
