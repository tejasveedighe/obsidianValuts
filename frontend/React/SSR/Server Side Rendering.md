- SSR is used to render web applications on the server side before sending them to client.
- The server creates the html code and sends it to the client improving the performance of app and reduces the render time of app.
- The html markup is static and is not interactive, until the client hydrates it and makes it interactive.
- The server rendered code makes issues with SEO, as the search engine might not be able to index the page in search results by bots.
