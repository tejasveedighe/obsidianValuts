- Static Binding is done at compile time.
- It is achieved using method overloading.
- Each method will have different method signature, and based on method call the method is recognized.
- Method Overloading - 
	- The Method name remains the same
	- The Number, type and order of parameters is different.
	- The Return Type must also remain the same as it is not considered as a part of method overloading.
- Operator Overloading - 
	- The operator is overloaded for specific use cases.
	- `public static ClassName Operator +(ClassName c1, ClassName c2){}`
